# Dzgaboard - Work in Progress

Dzgaboard is based on [Domoboard](https://github.com/wez3/domoboard). Dzgaboard is a dashboard for Domoticz based on Python Flask. The decision was made to use Domoticz as an backend because it is a powerful framework for home automation. Flask was choosen to get all the powerful features that Python offers.

# Ubuntu, Raspbarry Pi Installation with autostart

Just open a terminal window and execute this command. Thats it!

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DewGew/dzga-installer/master/dzgaboard_install.sh)
```

# Manual installation

To manually install Dzgaboard, take the steps below. 

Clone the git:

```
cd /home/${USER}/
git clone https://github.com/dewgew/dzgaboard
```

Create the virtualenv:

```
python3 -m venv /home/${USER}/dzgaboard/env 
```

Start the virtualenv:

```
cd /home/${USER}/dzgaboard/
source env/bin/activate
```

Install Dzgaboard dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start Domoboard by executing:

```
python3 server.py
```
Now you can goto http://server.ip.adress:8181.
Default admin login is username: 'admin' and password: 'admin'

Modify the config file to suit your needs. Then restart dzgaboard server.
It is possible to run Dzgaboard in "debug" mode by running the command:
```
python3 server.py -d
```

To reactivate the virtualenv later on repeat the "Start the virtualenv" step. 

# Install as a service

To configure Dzgaboard as a service, create a new file /etc/systemd/system/dzgaboard.service with the following contents (modify paths if Domoboard is not located at /home/pi):

```
[Unit]
Description=Dzgaboard dashboard

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/pi/dzgaboard/env/bin/python /home/pi/dzgaboard/server.py -d
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/dzgaboard/
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now run the following command to enable the service:

```
sudo systemctl enable dzgaboard.service 
```

Now run the following command to start the service:

```
sudo systemctl start dzgaboard.service 
```

Please note that if you are running Domoboard on ports <= 1024 a user with permissions needs to be specified (User and Group under [Service]). Otherwise Domoboard cannot bind to the port due to a permission denied error.
Domoboard writes an logfile to "logs/domoboard.log". This logfile contains all messages generated by Domoboard which can be useful for troubleshooting issues.

# Configuration

  - dimmer
  - rgb
  - setpoint
  - setpoint_slider
  - pushon
  - pushoff
  - group
  - scene
- camera
- weather
- news
- map
- domoticz_temp_charts
- domoticz_smart_charts

- donut_charts
- power_usage
- serverlog
- settings

# API

Dzgaboard has an API which can be found at "/api". All JavaScript files that update data frequently are using this API to obtain the information that is going to be displayed. By default all requests to the API are passed to the Domoticz backend. This means that Dzgaboard accepts the same API calls as Domoticz does.  However the API also allows an plugin developer to add its own API functions by creating an Python module. Developers can specify a "custom" GET-parameter which is patched in to the current API, this allows the developer to run their own Python functions when the API is called.

# Modulair

Domoboard is a framework which allows users to build custom plugins pretty easy. Plugins require the following at least:
- A HTML file in the templates/ folder (see templates/hello.html as an example)

For advanced features, such as custom API functions a developer needs to develop:
- A Python file in the plugins/ folder (see plugins/hello.py as an example)

The following plugins have been developed by now:
- iCloud plugin
- Traffic plugin

# Contributing

Everybody can contribute to the project! For development purposes the "develop" branch is used. The "master" branch contains the stable version of Domoboard.

Please let us know when you've created a plugin, so we can can add to the plugin Github repository.

# Special thanks

Special thanks to https://github.com/wez3 and https://github.com/squandor for developing Domoboard.
